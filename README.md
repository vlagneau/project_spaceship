# Project spaceship
Simple shoot them up project to learn how to use SDL and play with it.

##Dependencies
* SDL Library v1.2.15 (I know the v2 is out, but eh...)
* SDL_image Library v1.2.12
* SDL_TTF Library v2.0.11

##Images
I do not own the rights on the spaceship_sprite.png. I did not record the source or the author of this work and I am truly sorry.
Anyway it is a temporary image, it will be removed as soon as I get one from a friend

##Other stuff
